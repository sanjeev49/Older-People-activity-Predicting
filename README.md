### Older-People-activity-Predicting
The dataset of this project is taken from the UCI machine learning repository. 
It has two sub-datasets which was s1 and s2. 
I combined these two datasets and merge them into 1 by the name of real_data.csv.
It has 8 feature columns and  1 label which is an activity Label.
I have used 6 ml models to predict the Activity. Which are 
1. Logistic Regression
2. KNN
3. Support Vector Machine
4. DecisionTreeClassifier
5. Bagging
6. Stacking

After building models using train data I have tested it and it was giving good accuracy. So, I converted all of this 
6 model into pickle file. And Use it for future prediction. 
This is an ongoing project. Not finished yet. So you can see changes continuosally.
